# first attempt

SELECT DISTINCT tab1.NUM AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs AS tab1
  JOIN Logs AS tab2
  ON ABS(tab1.ID-ab2.ID)= 1
WHERE tab1.NUM = tab2.NUM;

#the solution is similar to mine

SELECT DISTINCT tab1.NUM AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs AS tab1
  INNER JOIN Logs AS tab2
  ON tab1.ID = tab2.ID-1
  INNER JOIN Logs AS tab3
  ON tab2.ID = tab3.ID - 1
where tab1.num = tab2.num AND tab2.num=tab3.num
;

#use  the condition tab1.ID = tab2.ID-1 to get the table I want.
