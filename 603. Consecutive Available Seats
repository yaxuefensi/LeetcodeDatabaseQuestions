# first attempt
SELECT seat_id
FROM cinema
WHERE free = 1 AND (seat_id



# after reading the solution
SELECT DISTINCT seat_id
FROM cinema AS a
  JOIN cinema AS b
  ON abs(a.seat_id - b.seat_id) = 1
WHERE a.free = 1 and b.free=1
ORDER BY seat_id;


#note1: JOIN ON  XX  don't necessarily to be a=b, it can be a-b=1, abs(a-b)=1
#note2:  abs( a)   to get the absolute value of number a
