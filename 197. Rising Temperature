SELECT w1.Id

 INNER JOIN Weather AS w2
 ON DATEDIFF(day,w2.date,w1.date)=1
WHERE w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature;


#after solution
SELECT w1.Id
FROM Weather AS w1
 INNER JOIN Weather AS w2
 ON w1.RecordDate -1 = w2.RecordDate
WHERE w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature;


# note: DATEDIFF(day,date1, date2) = 1  (date2 is one day later than date1)
