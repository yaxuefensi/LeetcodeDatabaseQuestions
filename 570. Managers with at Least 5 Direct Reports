# my first attemp
SELECT MgrName AS Name
FROM(
SELECT e1.ID AS EmpID, e1.Name AS EmpName, e2.Name AS MgrName
FROM Employee AS e1
  JOIN Employee AS e2
  ON e1.ManagerID = e2.ID) AS e
 GROUP BY MgrName
 HAVING COUNT(EmpID) > 4;
 
 # my second attempt after reading the solution
 
 SELECT Name
 FROM Employee AS e1
 JOIN
 (SELECT ManagerID 
 FROM Employee
 GROUP BY ManagerID
 HAVING COUNT(Id) > 4) AS e2
 ON e1.Id = e2.ManagerID;
 
 #1. the second try is much more consice
 #2. better understanding of  GROUP BY
 #3.  Keep in mind   
 SELECT * 
 FROM  table 1
 JOIN  table2
 ON xx = xx
 WHERE  XX
 GROUP BY XX
 HAVING XX
 ORDER BY  XXX
