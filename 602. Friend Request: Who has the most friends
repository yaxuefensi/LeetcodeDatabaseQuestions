SELECT id, COUNT(*)
FROM
(SELECT request_id AS id
 FROM request_accepted
 UNION ALL
 SELECT accepter_id
 FROM request_accepted)
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;



#
SELECT ids as id, cnt as num
FROM
(
SELECT ids, COUNT(*) as cnt
FROM
(SELECT request_id AS id
 FROM request_accepted
 UNION ALL
 SELECT accepter_id
 FROM request_accepted) as tbl1
GROUP BY ids
) as tbl2
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;



#union all will keep all the records even the 'duplicated' one
SELECT name, COUNT(*) as num
FROM
GROUPY BY name
ORDER BY num DESC.  this is correct
